COMMANDS
    r[ead] <seek> [count]
        Read `count` number of bytes from the position specified by `seek`.
        If `count` is omitted, read to the end of the file.

    r[ead]b <seek> [count]
        Same as `read`, but prints the contents as a hex dump. Useful for
        examining raw bytes.

    w[rite] <seek> <contents>
        Write the given text in `contents` to the file from the position
        specified by `seek`. `contents` can contain whitespace only after the
        first non-whitespace character.

    w[rite]b <seek> <hex bytes>
        Write the given raw bytes to the file. Bytes are written as
        space-separated hex values and are case-insensitive. e.g., `6C 6f 6C`.

    s[eek] <seek>
        Move the file pointer to the position specified by `seek`.

SEEK
    The following syntaxes are allowed for commands with a `seek` argument.

    .
        Keep file pointer at its current position.

    number      (e.g. 9)
        Move to the `number`th position from the beginning of the file.

    +number     (e.g. +10)
        Move forward `number` bytes from the current position. It is possible
        to seek beyond the end of a file.

    -number     (e.g. -2)
        Move backwards `number` bytes from the current position. Seeking to a
        position before byte 0 is an error.

    [number]<   (e.g. 40< , <)
        Move to the `number`'th byte from the end of the file. If `number` is
        omitted, move to the end of the file.
