SEEK
    The following syntaxes are allowed for commands with a `seek` argument.

    .
        Keep file pointer at its current position.

    number      (e.g. 9)
        Move to the `number`th position from the beginning of the file.

    +number     (e.g. +10)
        Move forward `number` bytes from the current position. It is possible
        to seek beyond the end of a file.

    -number     (e.g. -2)
        Move backwards `number` bytes from the current position. Seeking
        to a position before byte 0 is an error.

    [number]<   (e.g. 40< , <)
        Move to the `number`'th byte from the end of the file. If `number` is
        omitted, move to the end of the file.
